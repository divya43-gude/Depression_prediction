# Depression_prediction
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict depression states based on dataset attributes. The dataset contains various numerical and categorical features that indicate mental health conditions. The goal is to build and evaluate multiple ML models to classify individuals as depressed (Mild, Moderate, Severe) or not depressed.
